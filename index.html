    <h2>Why Adopt?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="whyadopt">
    <p>Every year, six to eight million dogs wait to be adopted from animals shelters. Adopting a shelter animal gives your pet a second chance in a happy home. By taking home your new pet, you also make room at the shelter for another animal with nowhere else to go. Animals undergo full physicals when they are brought to the shelter. Our shelter staff makes sure animals are in top shape before they are ready to be adopted into a new home. Many pet stores and even some breeders do not offer animals the same health services prior to adoption. The financial cost of adopting a shelter animal is almost always less than purchasing an animal from a breeder. Our shelter spay and neuter animals before adoption, saving adopters hundreds of dollars. Rescue animals are also often microchipped and vaccinated, which can cost up to $60 and $150, respectively. Finally, our shelter provides a space for animals of all different breeds, ages, shapes, sizes and personalities. We house so many different pets that you are sure to find an animal that fits your lifestyle and will serve as your perfect companion.</p>
