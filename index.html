  <div class="mission">
    <p>Chicago Animal Rescue is an organization that protects the lives and the welfare of animals. We believe every animal has the right to a well-balanced, socialized and fulfilled life. We take on the responsibility to save, rehabilitate and place abandoned, abused and stray animals. We provide medical, behavioral and physical support for animals despite their age, health and/or breed. Chicago Animal Rescue promotes sustainable living and care-giving within our communities by building awareness, appreciation and respect for all animals and the environment.

    <p>Our animals are amazing, however, they do require a lot of care and work. That's where you come in. We are always looking for loving and caring volunteers to help us continue our mission of saving and rehabilitating animals. This is your chance to make a bunch of new furry friends while also doing good. Whether you want to help with the animals or the prep work there is something for everyone, so don't hesitate and sign up below!
