  <div class="mission">
    <p>Chicago Animal Rescue is an organization that protects the lives and the welfare of animals. We believe every animal has the right to a well-balanced, socialized and fulfilled life. We take on the responsibility to save, rehabilitate and place abandoned, abused and stray animals. We provide medical, behavioral and physical support for animals despite their age, health and/or breed. Chicago Animal Rescue promotes sustainable living and care-giving within our communities by building awareness, appreciation and respect for all animals and the environment.
